# AppForge Privacy Policies

Privacy policies and data handling disclosures for mobile apps created by CW Apps & Games.

This repository hosts public privacy policies for apps developed under the AppForge Studio brand.

Each app uses a generic privacy policy, if required for a specific app it will be given its own folder containing a standalone HTML file to meet platform compliance (e.g., Google Play / AdMob).
